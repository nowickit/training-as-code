### Instance monitoring options
In most navigators, you have two options to monitor your instances: 
- Table view
- Heat map view
  
!Note:
*Table view is the default view for a navigator. Instances are sorted in descending order based on the relative value of the metric you select from the Color by drop-down menu. You can reverse the sorting order or select different sorting criteria by clicking available column headers. You can’t add or remove columns from the table view. In Heat map view, each square has a color representing the relative value of the metric you select from the Color by drop-down menu. The colors range from low values (lighter colors) to high values (darker colors). You can’t change the default colors for each Color‑by option. The navigator automatically sets the value range for each color.*
